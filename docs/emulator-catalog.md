# Lucent Android emulator catalog

Lucent uses standalone Android emulators and does not require RetroArch. The
catalog is keyed by systems that actually contain games. A missing emulator is
never removed automatically, even after the final game for its system is
deleted.

## Android installation boundary

A normal Android application cannot silently install a new third-party APK.
Lucent can identify the required emulator, fetch from a trusted official
source, and stage the package, but Android displays a package-installer
confirmation unless Lucent is provisioned as the device/profile owner. This is
an Android security boundary, not a theme limitation.

Systems without a maintained standalone Android emulator remain visible when
games are detected, but Lucent marks the emulator state as unsupported rather
than silently installing an abandoned or untrusted build.
